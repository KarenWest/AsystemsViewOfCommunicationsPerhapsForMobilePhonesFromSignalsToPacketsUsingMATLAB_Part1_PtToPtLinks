% 1. Use the function hist
% 2. Use the vector xhist defined above as the centers of the bins
% 3. The value of the histogram should be the percentage of samples in each bin,
%    where the percentage is expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (100%).
% 4. Plot the histogram using the MATLAB function BAR
