 
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the lab demo.
In the first lab, we have seen how we can use a communication
system to transmit a text message from one computer to another computer.
From this lab on, we're going to see how we can build our own communication
system step by step.
The first step of building any communication system
is to understand the channel.
Why?
Because if we don't know how the channel will affect our signal, there is no way
we can recover our information at the receiver side.
So the purpose of this lab is to determine
the step response of our channel.
The step response is defined as the response of the channel
to a step function.
So our first job is to create the step function.
Unfortunately, there's no way we can create a step function,
because it will last forever.
Fortunately, what we are concerned with is the position
where the step function steps up.
So we can create a pulse signal with sufficiently long pulse high time
to trigger the channel response and get the step response.
For that purpose, we first define the all one vector.
 
We define the bit duration to be 100 microseconds.
So we set SPB to 100.
Next, we change the bit sequence to waveform.
 
Different from last lab, we're not going to transmit and receive
the waveform by two boards.
What we are going to do is we're going to transmit and receive the waveform
by using the same board with the help of the reflection board.
What happens is the LED transmitter here will generate infrared signals.
The signals will be reflected by the board
and then captured by the receiver.
Let's see what kind of signal we can receive by sending this waveform.
 
Now, we are going to compare the received waveform with the transmitted step
function.
 
So here, we have two curves.
The red one is the ideal step function.
The blue one is the received actual response of the channel.
By comparing those two figures, we have several observations.
First one, we observed an offset signal, which
comes from the ambient light in this room.
Secondly, we have a time offset, which comes from the transmission delay
and the processing time on the board.
Thirdly, we see that the range of the response,
which is the difference between the minimum value and the maximum value,
is reduced from one to 0.25.
Thirdly, we observed an exponential channel response,
where the channel response increases from its minimum value
to its maximum value gradually.
In the lecture, we have proposed a mathematical model
to describe the channel response.
Now, let's see how we can use the model to predict the channel response.
For that purpose, we use the command fit_rcv.
And we randomly pick four parameters for the model.
For example, the signal offset we chose here is 0.3.
The time offset is 500.
That range parameter is 0.1.
And the exponential channel response parameter is 0.8.
Now, we have a figure, which includes two plots.
The upper plot gives the whole range of the waveform.
The lower plot focuses on the region, which we are more concerned with.
By comparing the predicted waveform, which is the green one,
and the actual response, which is the blue one,
we can see that we need to adjust the four
parameters to improve the fitting performance.
How can we do that?
So to determine the time offset and the signal offset,
I can simply put the data cursor at the position
where the channel starts to respond.
And we got two coordinates.
The x-coordinate here, 713, gives us the time offset.
The y-coordinate 0.3072 gives us the signal offset.
So what I can do now is I can change the signal offset to 0.3072.
And I can change the time offset to 713.
The range of the response is the difference between the maximum value
and the minimum value of the channel response.
We already determined the minimum value.
Now, we determine the maximum value by putting the data cursor
at the position with the maximum channel response.
And we got two coordinates.
The y-coordinate here, 0.6114, corresponds to the maximum channel
response.
So now, I can change the parameter to be the difference between 0.6114
and 0.3072.
Let's see how the three new parameters work.
Obviously, the predicted waveform, the green one,
now matches the actual response, the blue one,
in terms of the signal offset, time offset, and the range.
However, the predicted waveform increases much faster
compared to the actual one.
To solve this, we can simply increase the exponential channel response
parameter to 0.93.
OK, now, the predicted waveform matches the actual response perfectly.
This tells us the mathematical model proposed in the lecture is indeed
a good fit for the actual response.
And we're going to use it to design our communication system in future labs.
